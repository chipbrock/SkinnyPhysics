This Part introduces electricity and magnetism â€” another of the core of classical physics and also a source of important concepts for **QS&BB**. Much of quantum theory was finding a modern view of light and in particle physics we use the quantum particles of light all the time. But electricity, magnetism, and optics are all the same side of a theoretical coin (which I guess suggests a three-sided coin...but Quantum Mechanics is strange).

ðŸ‘ˆ Read or skim, depending on your background. So many of these concepts have stood the test of time. As always, my goal is to get you ready for the 21st century physics of particle physics and cosmology.
