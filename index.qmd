# Introduction to Skinny Physics

I'm guessing that you might come from various backgrounds and since posts in **QS&BB** may rely on a small bit of background, I've created this Skinny Physics collection to help you whether you're an English major with little physics in your life to an engineer with more.

## Chapter structure

Each chapter has the same structure in support of your particular level of preparation:

1. **Just the facts.** The equations for those of you who might have had some physics in your background and need a referesher
2. **Different way.** There are some places where I introduce ways of approaching thingss in QSBB that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere. So follow those links for sure.
4. **Gentle explanations of..**. This is textbook-like, but textbook-lite. From the beginning but not overpowering. Some videos of explanation.
3. **Pointers** to topics so you can quickly go to a topic where you need more than just the equations. That's #4 just above ðŸ‘†

The Parts are:

1. Mechanics
   1. Motion
   2. Momentum and Force
   3. Collisions
   4. Energy
2. Gravitation
   1. Copernicus' heliocentric proposal
   2. Galileo's Astronomy
   3. Kepler's Astrophysics
   4. Newton's Gravitation
3. Electricity and Magnetism
   1. Electric Charge and Magnetism
   2. Faraday's Experiments and Conclusions
   3. Maxwell's Theory
   4. Forces on electrical charges
4. Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity
