This Part introduces mechanics â€” the core of classical physics and a source of important concepts for **QS&BB**, not to mention a lot of vocabulary of physics...momentum, force, energy, and so on.

Here you can see the main themes as a review or for the first time, key equations, or learning goals before readers dive into each chapter.

Each chapter has four levels of detail:
1. Just the facts. The equations for those of you who might have had some physics in your background and need a referesher
2. Different way. There are some places where I introduce ways of approaching thingss in QSBB that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere. So follow those links for sure.
4. Gentle explanations of... This is textbook-like, but textbook-lite. From the beginning but not overpowering. Some videos of explanation.
3. Pointers to topics so you can quickly go to a topic where you need more than just the equations. That's #4 just above ðŸ‘†
