This Part introduces mechanics â€” the core of classical physics and a source of important concepts for **QS&BB**, not to mention a lot of vocabulary of physics...velocity, momentum, force, energy, and so on.

ðŸ‘ˆ Read or skim, depending on your background. So many of these concepts have stood the test of time. As always, my goal is to get you ready for the 21st century physics of particle physics and cosmology.
