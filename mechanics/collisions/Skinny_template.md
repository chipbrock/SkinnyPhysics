# Skinny Motion, Speed, and Acceleration

This is the first of three outlines of some basic physics ideas so that I can refer to them in other posts. If you'd like more, including history and examples, then visit [full textbook](https://qstbb.pa.msu.edu/storage/ISP220_fall2020/QS&BB2020/intro.html) for a textbook-level presentation. If you only need the basic simple equations, they're here. If you'd like some explanation, that's next!

$$E=mc^2$$

Units. Sorry. In QS&BB we won't care about English versus metric units but for this motion review we'll sometimes have to convert. I'll do it for you but you can check me at places like [unitjuggler](https://www.unitjuggler.com/index.html)...or often just Google.

ü´µ  Even if you know some of the basics of velocity and acceleration, you need to be comfortable with spacetime diagrams in @sec-spacetimediagrams ! That's how we'll pursue Feynman Diagrams.

## Pointers to topics:

üîê Bottom line sections with stuff to remember in this chapter:

-   average speed @sec-averagespeed

-   spacespace and spacetime diagrams @sec-spacetimediagrams

-   the set of equations for 1-dimensional motion @sec-equationsofmotion

-   2 dimensional motion: projectiles @sec-projectiles
